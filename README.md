<h2 id="usage">Usage</h2>
<p>
    To run the Social Media Scraper, simply execute the following command within
    the project directory:
</p>
<code>mix run social_media_scraper.ex</code>
<p>
    This command will initiate the scraping process, and you’ll start seeing your
    fetched posts in the terminal. You can customize various parameters such as 
    the social media platform, keywords, and the number of posts to scrape by
    modifying the configuration file located at <code>config/config.exs</code>. 
</p>
<p>
    If you wish to view the fetched data in a more structured manner, export it 
    to a CSV file by running:
</p>
<code>mix run social_media_scraper.ex -o output.csv</code>
<p>
    This way, you can easily analyze the data or share it with your team. Make 
    sure to check the documentation for specific scraping commands and options.
